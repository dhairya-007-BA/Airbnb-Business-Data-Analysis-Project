# Airbnb-Business-Data-Analysis-Project

This project was created to explore how data analysis can help uncover valuable business insights within the Airbnb marketplace. By analyzing key metrics like pricing, ratings, and geographic distribution, the goal is to better understand what drives successful listings and how hosts or platforms can make informed strategic decisions.

The project focuses on analyzing an Airbnb dataset to answer questions such as:
What is the distribution of prices and ratings across listings?
Which countries and hosts dominate the platform?
What features (e.g., number of beds, bathrooms) correlate with higher prices?
Where are the most expensive listings located?
It includes data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visual exploration to draw meaningful conclusions from raw data.

The analysis was performed using the following tools and steps:
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed formatting inconsistencies (e.g., commas in numeric columns), and dropped irrelevant columns
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Created visualizations for price and rating distributions, listing volumes by country and host, and a correlation heatmap between features
Business Insight Generation: Identified trends in host performance, geographic pricing differences, and potential optimization strategies for listings
